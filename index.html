    <h1 id="leadership" class="color" style="margin-left: 650px;">Leadership</h1>

    <p class="color">According to me, 'Leadership is influence - nothing more,
       nothing less ’that’s why always follow the rule of grabbing an opportunity and striking on it.
        I always followed the rule to be the pioneer/first to do anything and believed not in meeting demand
         but in creating demand. I always believe in picking up the best talent and having a motivated workforce. 
         I only believe in providing leadership, vision, and strategy. I have the zeal to achieve 
         something big rather than just earning money and the obsession to build. 
      I can bring about change, therefore, I have this ability to be a leader.</p>

  <div>

    <h1 id="Creativity" class="color" style="margin-left: 650px;">Creativity</h1>

    <p class="color">Creativity is the ability to think about a task or a
       problem in a new or different way, or the ability to use my imagination
        to generate new ideas and I can say that I have this skill because
         I am always eager to solve complex problems or find interesting ways to approach tasks.
          I look at things from a unique perspective and find patterns and make connections to
           find opportunities. There is some risk involved with being creative, but never try to 
           give up and try to be self-motivated to try things that have not been done before.
            Being creative allows me to accept the challenge of conventional wisdom. 
            This allows me to look for better ways to do that task or revise the procedures
             to make them more relevant.

       and calmly identify solutions Problem-solving skills are traits that enable me to do

         like relationship building and everyday day-to-day decision making. The initial step
          to taking care of any issue is to dissect the circumstance. My problem-solving 
          abilities will assist me with understanding issues and successfully foster solutions.
           Critical thinking abilities are important in every career at each level. The initial
            step to tackling any issue is to examine the circumstance. My problem-solving skills
             will assist me with getting issues and viably foster the solution. I need this logical
              ability during research to help recognize effective and ineffective solutions during 
              research and distinguish between effective and ineffective solutions.
